Vincent Tessier, Director of Software Engineering at Drips
Parker worked with Vincent in the same group
Parker is an
excellent hands-on leader and manager with great expertise in all aspects of
software quality. We have been working together for almost 3 years and I have seen
him solving very difficult problems with strong time constraints. Parker makes
decisions based on data. His vision, skills and process improvements of QA are
outstanding while providing very detailed reporting of all stages of QA operations.
He is also very focused on automation to improve test coverage in all areas of
software products. His managerial skills are excellent. Overall, I strongly
recommend Parker.
